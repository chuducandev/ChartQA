The area chart illustrates the political regime distribution worldwide from 1789 to 2022, based on classifications by Lührmann et al. (2018) and V-Dem's experts. In 1789, closed autocracies dominated the landscape, with no presence of electoral autocracies or democracies. By 1850, electoral autocracies began to emerge, with 13 countries, while closed autocracies increased to 63. The presence of electoral democracies was still minimal, with only 1 country. Progressing to 1900, the number of closed autocracies rose to 95, and electoral autocracies saw a modest increase to 21 countries. The number of electoral democracies slightly grew to 2, with 1 country each for ages 18 and 30. By 1950, the number of closed autocracies peaked at 105, while electoral autocracies rose to 24 countries. Notably, electoral democracies began to show more diversity, with 15 countries aged 18, 3 aged 30, 4 aged 60, 1 aged 90, and 2 aged 91+. The year 2000 marked a significant shift with closed autocracies declining to 35 countries and electoral autocracies increasing to 57. There was a substantial rise in electoral democracies, with 49 countries aged 18, 8 aged 30, 18 aged 60, 6 aged 90, and 4 aged 91+. The trend continued in 2018 with closed autocracies further decreasing to 23 countries and electoral autocracies at 61. The number of electoral democracies aged 18 saw a decrease to 24, but there was an increase in older democracies, with 30 countries aged 30, 18 aged 60, 12 aged 90, and 10 aged 91+. By 2022, closed autocracies rose slightly to 30 countries, while electoral autocracies decreased to 58. The number of electoral democracies aged 18 dropped to 20, and aged 30 saw a decrease to 16, but there was an increase in older democracies, with 30 countries aged 60, 14 aged 90, and 10 aged 91+. The chart highlights the decline of closed autocracies and the rise of electoral democracies, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century into the 21st century.

The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between per capita electricity consumption and GDP per capita (PPP) for various countries and regions in 2021. A general trend can be observed where countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher per capita electricity consumption. For instance, Qatar, with one of the highest GDPs per capita, also has a high per capita electricity consumption of approximately 17,673 kWh. On the other end of the spectrum, countries like Burundi and Niger, with very low GDP per capita, also have low per capita electricity consumption, around 28.68 kWh and 17.82 kWh respectively. High-income countries, as a group, show a high per capita electricity consumption of about 9,354 kWh, coupled with a high GDP per capita of $50,122. The plot also includes continental aggregates, such as Africa and Asia, which have lower per capita electricity consumption (602 kWh and 3,310 kWh respectively) compared to North America and Europe, which have higher consumption (8,802 kWh and 6,457 kWh respectively). The data for Bermuda is notable as it shows zero per capita electricity consumption, likely due to its reliance on other sources for energy, despite a high GDP per capita of $80,271.13. The size of the circles represents the population of the entities, with larger circles indicating more populous countries. This visualization provides insights into the relationship between economic status and energy consumption patterns.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between cereal yield (kg per hectare) and GDP per capita (PPP, constant 2017 international $) for various countries and regions in 2020. The data points are color-coded to represent different continents. A general trend can be observed where countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher cereal yields. Notable outliers with high cereal yields include Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, both with GDP per capita above $30,000 and cereal yields over 10 kg per hectare. In contrast, many African countries have both low GDP per capita (under $5,000) and low cereal yields (under 2 kg per hectare). The size of the circles represents the population of the country, with larger circles indicating more populous countries. High-income countries are clustered in the upper right quadrant, indicating both high GDP per capita and high cereal yield, while low-income countries are in the lower left quadrant, with low GDP per capita and cereal yield. The World average GDP per capita is marked at approximately $16,176 with a cereal yield of 4.07 kg per hectare. The plot also includes a diagonal line that represents the equal GDP per capita and cereal yield, with points above this line indicating countries with higher cereal yield than GDP per capita. The highest cereal yield observed is in Oman at approximately 18.62 kg per hectare with a GDP per capita of around $33,098. The United States is another notable point with a cereal yield of 8.18 kg per hectare and a GDP per capita of $60,167.85. The data suggests a positive correlation between economic prosperity and agricultural productivity.

In contrast, countries like Liberia, Ethiopia, and Lesotho have very low access, particularly in rural areas, with Liberia having less than 1% in rural areas. A general trend can be observed where urban populations tend to have higher access to handwashing facilities than rural populations within the same country. However, there are exceptions, such as Bhutan, where rural access is higher than urban access. The chart also color-codes countries by continent, providing a visual comparison between continents. For instance, African countries generally show lower access rates compared to Asian and European countries. The data highlights the disparities in access to basic hygiene services between rural and urban areas across different countries.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the Hidden Hunger Index in pre-school children (HHI-PD) and the share of the population living on less than $2.15 a day across various countries and continents in 2012. The Hidden Hunger Index, which reflects nutritional deficiencies, ranges from 8.3% to 51.3%, while the share of the population in extreme poverty varies significantly, from as low as 0.06% in Russia to as high as 80.73% in Madagascar. The plot also indicates the population size of each country, with larger circles representing more populous nations. For instance, India, with a large circle, exhibits a high Hidden Hunger Index of 48.3% and a substantial share of its population living in extreme poverty at 32.87%. In contrast, Brazil shows a lower Hidden Hunger Index of 16% and a much lower share of its population living in extreme poverty at 4.49%. The data suggests a general trend where countries with higher shares of their population living in extreme poverty also have higher Hidden Hunger Index scores, indicating a potential correlation between poverty and nutritional deficiencies among pre-school children. However, there are exceptions to this trend, such as Iran, which has a moderate Hidden Hunger Index of 25% but a very low share of its population living in extreme poverty at 1.49%. The data for some countries like Bhutan and Chile also show a decrease in the share of the population living in extreme poverty between 2009 and 2012. The plot provides a visual representation of the complex relationship between nutrition and poverty, highlighting the challenges faced by many countries in addressing these critical issues.

Poland did not have sovereign state status until 1950, after which it maintained recognition. The Republic of Vietnam, on the other hand, has consistently been marked as not having sovereign state status throughout the entire timeline. South Africa achieved recognition as a sovereign state in 1950, similar to Poland. The United States, in contrast, has been consistently recognized as a sovereign state from 1816 onwards. The chart demonstrates the dynamic nature of sovereign statehood, with entities like Poland and South Africa gaining recognition over time, while others like the Republic of Vietnam have not been recognized as sovereign states at any point during the observed period.
The line chart illustrates the total disease burden in France from 2000 to 2019, measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for all causes and both sexes across all age groups. Over the 19-year period, there has been a gradual increase in the number of DALYs lost, indicating a rising disease burden. In the year 2000, France experienced a loss of approximately 16.7 million DALYs, which remained stable through 2005. However, by 2010, there was a slight increase to around 16.8 million DALYs, and this trend continued, with losses rising to about 17.1 million DALYs in 2015 and reaching approximately 17.3 million DALYs by 2019. The chart shows a consistent upward trend, reflecting a growing burden of disease in the population of France.
The scatter plot compares adult female literacy rates in 2018 between two different data sources: the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Each point represents a country, with the x-axis showing the literacy rate from DHS surveys and the y-axis showing the literacy rate from UNESCO self-reports. The size of the circles corresponds to the population of the country. A general trend can be observed where countries with higher literacy rates according to UNESCO also have higher rates according to DHS. Notable outliers include Afghanistan, which has a very low literacy rate according to both sources, and Indonesia, which has a high literacy rate according to UNESCO but not as high according to DHS. The plot also highlights the vast differences in literacy rates between countries, with some nearing 100% and others below 30%. The data suggests that while there is a correlation between the two sources of literacy rate data, there are also significant discrepancies between them for certain countries.

Northern America exhibits the highest labor share with 60.5%, indicating that a larger portion of GDP is allocated to employee compensation compared to other regions. Europe follows with a labor share of 58.0%. On the other end of the spectrum, Northern Africa has the lowest labor share at 43.4%, suggesting that a smaller proportion of GDP is distributed to employees there. The global average labor share stands at 53.8%, which is above the labor shares of several regions, including Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, all of which hover around 51-52%. Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as Oceania, have labor shares of 51.0% and 55.2%, respectively. These figures highlight the varying distribution of economic output between labor and capital across different regions of the world.
The line chart illustrates the death rate from maternal disorders per 100,000 people in Afghanistan from 1990 to 2019. There is a clear downward trend over the three decades. In 1990, the death rate stood at 32.74 deaths per 100,000 people. This rate saw a gradual decrease, reaching 30.73 by 1995 and further declining to 28.99 by the year 2000. The trend continued with the death rate dropping to 25.49 in 2005 and then to 20.48 by 2010. A significant reduction was observed by 2015, with the rate falling to 15.02, and by 2019, it had more than halved from the 1990 figure, reaching 12.36 deaths per 100,000 people. This data suggests substantial progress in maternal health care in Afghanistan over the 29-year period.
The area chart illustrates the global trend in the implementation of equal age of consent laws for same-sex and different-sex partners from 1991 to 2019. In 1991, there were 139 countries with unequal or partially equal age of consent laws, while 54 countries had equal age of consent laws for all genders. Over the years, there has been a noticeable shift towards equality. By 1995, the number of countries with unequal or partially equal age of consent decreased to 132, and those with equal age of consent increased to 61. This trend continued, and by the year 2000, the number of countries with equal age of consent rose to 77, surpassing those with unequal or partially equal age of consent for the first time. The trend of equality persisted, with 92 countries having equal age of consent by 2005. This number held steady through 2010 and 2015, indicating a plateau in progress. However, by 2019, there was a slight increase in the number of countries with equal age of consent, reaching 104, while those with unequal or partially equal age of consent laws decreased to 89. This data suggests that while progress has been made, the pace of change has slowed down in recent years.
The line chart illustrates the projections of the global total dependency ratio from 1950 to 2100 based on the United Nations' medium population scenario. The dependency ratio is the number of dependents (young and old) per 100 working-age population. In 1950, the total dependency ratio was at 66.24, which saw an increase by 1960 reaching 73.58. However, by 1980, there was a slight decrease to 70.25. The downward trend continued into the 21st century, with the ratio dropping to 59.0 in 2000 and further to 54.12 in 2020. Projections beyond 2020 indicate a reversal in the trend, with the ratio expected to rise to 56.41 by 2040, and then to 61.85 by 2060. The upward trend is expected to continue with the ratio reaching 65.76 by 2080 and culminating at 68.09 by 2100. This data suggests that while the dependency ratio has been decreasing over the past few decades, the long-term trend indicates an increase in the coming decades.

The overall trend across all countries indicates an improvement in stroke-related health outcomes over the two decades.
The area chart illustrates the distribution of the world's population living under different political regimes from 1800 to 2022. In 1800, the majority of the world's population lived under closed autocracies (approximately 806 million), with a small fraction living in electoral autocracies (around 22 million) and electoral democracies (about 20 million). By 1950, the population under closed autocracies had increased significantly to over 1.7 billion, while those living in electoral democracies had grown to 218 million. A dramatic shift occurred by 2000, with the population in electoral democracies reaching over 1.6 billion, surpassing those in closed autocracies. In 2018, the trend continued with the population in electoral democracies at approximately 1.23 billion, while those in closed autocracies decreased to around 1.85 billion. By 2022, the population in electoral democracies had further increased to over 3.16 billion, indicating a clear trend towards democratic governance globally. The chart also shows a small but notable population living in liberal democracies, peaking at around 877 million in 2000 before declining slightly to about 794 million in 2022. The data suggests a significant move towards more democratic forms of governance over the past two centuries.

Uruguay also reported zero deaths across the entire timeline. The chart highlights the variability and severity of intrastate conflicts over time, with some countries experiencing high levels of conflict-related fatalities while others remain unaffected.
The line chart illustrates the growth of the global population from 1900 to 2015, with and without the contribution of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers produced via the Haber-Bosch process. In 1900, the world population was approximately 1.65 billion, and it increased to 3.38 billion by 1960. A significant rise is observed from 1960 to 2015, where the population reached approximately 7.38 billion. The chart also shows the hypothetical world population without the use of Haber-Bosch nitrogen fertilizers, which is consistently lower than the actual world population, suggesting the impact of synthetic fertilizers on agricultural productivity and, consequently, population growth. The difference between the two populations widens over time, indicating that a larger and larger share of the global population is dependent on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers for food production. By 2015, the world population fed by Haber-Bosch nitrogen was about 3.54 billion, which is nearly half of the total global population at that time. This data underscores the critical role of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers in modern agriculture and its contribution to the growth of the world's population.

Gibraltar's data point in 2000 indicates a lower percentage of 9.56%. Kyrgyzstan's enrolment in private pre-primary institutions was at 0% in 1990, showing no private institution enrolment, but it has since seen a gradual increase to 3.86% by 2019. The chart highlights Kuwait's substantial growth in private pre-primary education enrolment over the years, in contrast to the relatively low and stable percentages for Gibraltar and the modest but increasing trend for Kyrgyzstan.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the death rate from indoor air pollution and GDP per capita for various countries in 2019. The death rate is measured per 100,000 individuals and is attributed to the use of indoor solid fuels for cooking and heating. A clear trend can be observed where countries with lower GDP per capita have higher death rates due to indoor air pollution. For instance, countries like Afghanistan, Somalia, and the Central African Republic have death rates exceeding 150 per 100,000 people, with GDP per capita figures under $2,000. In contrast, wealthier nations such as Australia and Bermuda have death rates close to zero, with GDP per capita above $40,000. The data also categorizes countries by continent, providing a visual representation of the disparities between regions. This chart highlights the significant impact of economic status on health outcomes related to indoor air pollution.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the annual average growth of global merchandise exports as a share of GDP and GDP per capita for various countries and regions from 1945 to 2014. The data points are color-coded to represent different continents. A general trend suggests that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have a lower share of global merchandise exports as a percentage of GDP. For instance, Ireland, with a high GDP per capita of $52,651 in 2014, has a relatively low export share of 57.73%. In contrast, countries with lower GDP per capita, such as Congo and Vietnam, exhibit higher export shares, with Congo at 73.41% and Vietnam at 85.95% in 2014. The size of the circles represents the population of the country or region, with larger circles indicating a larger population. The plot also includes annotations for selected countries, providing additional information such as GDP per capita and population figures for the years 2014 and 1945. The annotations for Congo and Vietnam highlight the significant export shares of these countries despite their lower GDP per capita compared to Ireland. The data for some countries like Haiti and Cuba show a decrease in export share over time, while others like China and India show an increase. The scatter plot provides insights into the complex relationship between a country's economic size and its participation in global trade.
The bubble chart illustrates the relationship between the percentage of children in employment (ages 7-14) and their average weekly working hours in various countries and continents for the year 2016. The size of each bubble represents the population of the country or continent. Notably, countries like Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines have high percentages of children in employment, with Nigeria having over 50% of children in employment, but the average working hours are not specified. On the other hand, Jordan has a lower percentage of children in employment at around 20%, with an average of 15.54 hours per week. The chart also shows that some countries with higher percentages of children in employment, such as Brazil and Mexico, have lower average working hours, indicating that a larger proportion of children work fewer hours. The data suggests a diverse range of child employment practices across different regions, with some countries exhibiting higher rates of child labor with fewer hours worked, while others have lower rates but with longer working hours. The chart does not provide data for the average working hours for countries with the highest percentages of children in employment.
The line chart illustrates the percentage of government expenditure going towards interest payments from 1972 to 2020 for the Marshall Islands and Switzerland. For Switzerland, there is a clear upward trend in interest payments as a percentage of expense from 1972, starting at 2.04%, peaking at 4.19% in 2000, and then declining significantly to 0.68% by 2020. The Marshall Islands, on the other hand, show a much smaller range and a downward trend from 1.02% in 2010 to 0.46% in 2020. The data suggests that Switzerland had a higher burden of interest payments on its government debt in the 1990s and 2000s compared to the Marshall Islands, and that both countries have managed to reduce the proportion of their expenses dedicated to interest payments over time.
The line chart presents the global infant mortality rate by sex from 1990 to 2021. For both sexes, a consistent decline in infant mortality rates is observed. In 1990, the infant mortality rate for females was approximately 6.05 deaths per 100 live births, which decreased to about 2.61 deaths per 100 live births by 2021. For males, the rate was slightly higher at the beginning of the period, standing at around 6.84 deaths per 100 live births in 1990, and it decreased to approximately 3.06 deaths per 100 live births by 2021. The chart shows that the mortality rate for males has always been higher than for females throughout the years, but the gap between the two has narrowed over time as both rates have declined. The overall trend indicates significant improvements in infant survival worldwide over the 31-year period.
The chart presents the scores for democratic electoral institutions in Argentina, Australia, Botswana, and China from 2005 to 2022, based on assessments by Freedom House. Argentina and Botswana both maintained a consistent score of 11 throughout the period, indicating stable levels of democratic electoral institutions. Australia, which scored the highest at 12, also showed no change over the years, reflecting an unchanging level of democratic electoral institutions as per Freedom House's assessment. In stark contrast, China consistently scored 0, indicating a complete absence of democratic electoral institutions according to the same assessment. This data suggests a static situation in terms of democratic electoral institutions for Argentina, Australia, and Botswana, while China remained non-democratically electoral throughout the years in question.

Russia's median age increased from 23.4 years in 1950 to 38.6 years in 2020. The United Kingdom's median age has been on an upward trend since 1950, reaching 39.5 years in 2020. Projections for 2040 and beyond show a continued increase in median age for all countries, with Japan expected to have the highest median age by 2100 at 54.4 years, while Nigeria is projected to have the lowest at 34.5 years. The United States is forecasted to have a median age of 47.3 years by 2100. These trends reflect the overall aging of the global population.
The line chart presents the global under-fifteen mortality rate, measured in deaths per 100 live births, from 1990 to 2021. There is a clear downward trend over the 31-year period. In 1990, the mortality rate was at 10.62 deaths per 100 live births. This rate consistently decreased, reaching 9.88 deaths per 100 live births in 1995 and further declining to 8.64 deaths per 100 live births by the year 2000. The trend continued with the mortality rate dropping to 7.24 deaths per 100 live births in 2005, and then to 5.96 deaths per 100 live births by 2010. The rate kept falling, reaching 5.02 deaths per 100 live births in 2015. The most recent data from 2021 shows the under-fifteen mortality rate has further decreased to 4.40 deaths per 100 live births, marking significant progress in reducing child mortality worldwide.
The area chart illustrates the political regime types in South America from 1789 to 2022. In 1789, South America was entirely under closed autocracies, with no presence of other regime types. By 1850, the number of closed autocracies increased to 8, while electoral autocracies made a debut with 2. No liberal democracies were observed until 2000, where electoral democracies started to dominate with 9, while closed autocracies and electoral autocracies diminished to 0 and 1, respectively. The year 2018 marked the emergence of long-standing liberal democracies, with 1 each for ages 18-30 and 31-60, and 1 for electoral democracies aged 91+. As of 2022, the distribution of regime types remained largely unchanged from 2018, except for the addition of a long-standing liberal democracy aged 61-90. The chart highlights the transition of South America from being almost exclusively under closed autocracies in the 18th and 19th centuries to a more diverse political landscape in the 21st century, with the presence of electoral democracies and long-standing liberal democracies.
The line chart illustrates the income share of the richest decile (top 10%) in China, France, South Africa, and the United States from various years spanning 1910 to 2021. In France, the share of the richest decile saw a gradual decline from 51.84% in 1910 to 31.28% in 1980, followed by a slight increase to 33.25% in 2000. For China, the share rose from 27.89% in 1980 to 35.87% in 2000.

South Africa's data point in 2000 indicates a relatively high income share for the richest decile compared to the other countries at that time.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the annual change in forest area and GDP per capita for various countries in 2015. A positive change in forest area indicates reforestation, while a negative change indicates net deforestation. Countries with higher GDP per capita, such as Ireland ($71,490.805) and Norway ($62,987.516), show a positive change in forest area, suggesting reforestation efforts. In contrast, countries with lower GDP per capita, like Malawi ($1,440.8423) and Somalia ($1,029.6992), exhibit negative changes, indicating net deforestation. Notably, Bahrain, despite having a high GDP per capita of $48,453.727, also shows a positive change in forest area, potentially due to its small land area and limited deforestation pressure. The Cayman Islands, with an exceptionally high GDP per capita of $68,135.46, have no recorded change in forest area, likely due to their small size and lack of forested land. Overall, the data suggests that wealthier countries are more likely to engage in reforestation, while poorer countries face challenges in preserving forest areas.
The line chart illustrates the percentage of children aged 7-14 in employment in Nepal, separated by gender, from 1999 to 2014. In 1999, a higher percentage of female children (52.4%) were employed compared to male children (42.2%). Over the years, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of employed children for both genders. By 2008, the percentage for female children decreased to 45.4%, while for male children, it dropped to 36.2%. However, in 2014, there was a slight increase in the percentage of male children in employment, reaching 41.5%, whereas the percentage of female children slightly decreased to 44.1%. Throughout the period, the percentage of employed female children has been consistently higher than that of male children.

The area chart illustrates the global population distribution between people living in democracies and non-democracies from 1800 to 2020, with a particular focus on the years 2000, 2013, and 2020. In 1800, the entire world's population of approximately 1 billion lived in non-democracies, with no one living in democracies. By 1900, a small fraction of the population began living in democracies, but the vast majority still resided in non-democracies. A significant shift occurred by 1950, with over 900 million people living in democracies, surpassing the number living in non-democracies with women's suffrage for the first time. The trend continued, and by 2000, the population in democracies with women's suffrage had risen dramatically to approximately 3.37 billion, significantly outpacing the population in non-democracies with women's suffrage, which stood at around 275 million. The gap between the two remained substantial in 2013, with 4.12 billion in democracies and 3.07 billion in non-democracies. However, by 2020, the population in non-democracies with women's suffrage had increased to around 3.63 billion, almost catching up with the population in democracies, which stood at about 4.11 billion. The chart also shows a small fraction of the population living in non-democracies without women's suffrage in 2000 and 2013, but no data is provided for 2020 in this regard. The overall trend indicates a substantial and consistent increase in the global population living in democracies with women's suffrage over the past two centuries.

The chart highlights the significant growth in potato production in lower-middle-income countries, which far exceeds the other regions and countries shown.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the share of government consumption in GDP and GDP per capita for various countries and regions in 2019. The share of government consumption in GDP is plotted on the y-axis, while GDP per capita is plotted on the x-axis. The size of the circles represents the population of each entity, with larger circles indicating a larger population. Notably, Equatorial Guinea has the highest share of government consumption in GDP at approximately 47%, despite having a GDP per capita of around $24,712.76. In contrast, Haiti has the lowest share at around 2.27%, with a GDP per capita of approximately $1,554.02. The United States, with a GDP per capita of $62,589, has a share of government consumption in GDP of about 11.5%. The plot also shows continental aggregates, with Africa and Asia having the largest populations, as indicated by the size of their respective circles. The data suggests that there is no clear correlation between the share of government consumption in GDP and GDP per capita across the entities displayed. However, the data does indicate that countries with higher GDP per capita do not necessarily have a higher share of government consumption in GDP. The plot also includes data for regions such as North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania, as well as continental aggregates for Africa and Asia.
The line chart illustrates the decline in the share of the population living on less than $2 per day in Australia, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 1820 to 2017. In 1820, a significant portion of the population in all countries except Italy lived under this threshold, with Australia having the highest share at 64.15%. Over the years, there has been a dramatic decrease in these figures, reflecting substantial improvements in living standards. By 2017, the share of the population living under $2 per day in all countries was close to zero, with Australia and the United States having the lowest shares at 1.53 x 10^-8 and 6.14 x 10^-6, respectively. The trend is consistent across all countries, indicating a global improvement in economic conditions over the nearly two-century period. Notably, the share of the population living under $2 per day in Italy remained relatively high until the mid-20th century before falling sharply. The data suggests that by 2017, extreme poverty, as defined by living on less than $2 per day, was virtually eradicated in these developed nations.

The Philippines saw an increase from 220 million in 1995 to 342 million in 2015. Jordan had a substantial one-time spike in 2010, from 1.57 million in 2005 to 503.54 million. Overall, the chart indicates varying trends in rail passenger transportation across these countries.
The area chart illustrates the breakdown of the global age dependency ratio from 1950 to 2021, distinguishing between young dependents (0-14 years) and old-age dependents (over 64 years). In 1950, the child dependency ratio stood at 57.71, which was the highest recorded value on the chart, indicating a significant burden of young dependents. Over the years, this ratio has seen a steady decline, reaching 39.26 by 2021. Conversely, the old-age dependency ratio started at 8.53 in 1950 and has been on an upward trajectory, more than doubling to 14.83 by 2021. This trend reflects the changing demographic composition of the world's population, with a growing proportion of elderly individuals and a decreasing proportion of young children. The chart also shows that the rate of increase in the old-age dependency ratio has been consistently higher than that of the child dependency ratio in recent decades, underscoring the challenges posed by an aging population.
The line chart illustrates the age-standardized death rate from tuberculosis per 100,000 people in Tanzania from 1990 to 2019. There is a clear downward trend throughout the years. In 1990, the death rate was at its highest with 150.37 deaths per 100,000 individuals. The rate consistently decreased over the subsequent decades, reaching 141.28 in 1995, and then further declining to 129.66 by the year 2000. The downward trend continued in the years that followed, with the death rate dropping to 107.08 in 2005, and then to 90.38 by 2010. The rate kept falling, reaching 83.01 in 2015, and eventually, the lowest recorded rate was 68.54 in 2019. This data indicates significant progress in reducing the impact of tuberculosis in Tanzania over a span of nearly 30 years.

The line chart illustrates the annual quantity of insecticides used in agriculture, measured in tonnes of active ingredient, for Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom from 1990 to 2020. Australia's use of insecticides has shown a consistent increase over the years, starting at approximately 4,000 tonnes in 1990 and reaching about 14,200 tonnes by 2020. Belgium's usage has decreased over time, from around 925 tonnes in 2000 to about 556 tonnes in 2020. The Netherlands initially decreased from 731 tonnes in 1990 to 553 tonnes in 1995, followed by a rise to approximately 2,500 tonnes by 2020. The United Kingdom's use has significantly declined, from around 2,083 tonnes in 1990 to just about 317 tonnes in 2020. The chart indicates a contrasting trend between Australia and the other three countries, with Australia's use of insecticides increasing substantially while the others have either decreased or remained relatively stable.
The bar chart illustrates the number of nuclear weapons tests conducted by various countries from 1945 to 2022. The United States and Russia, two of the most significant nuclear powers, show a high number of tests in the early years, with the United States peaking at 47 tests in 1963 and Russia reaching its highest with 31 tests in 1978. After 1990, the number of tests by both countries dropped dramatically to zero, reflecting a shift in nuclear testing policy. The United Kingdom, France, and China also conducted tests, with France reaching a peak of 12 tests in 1981 and China peaking at 11 tests in 1978. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are shown to have conducted only a single test, with North Korea's test occurring in 2017. Overall, the trend indicates a significant reduction in the number of nuclear weapons tests over time, with a notable decline after the 1980s. The chart also includes a category for other countries, which shows a few sporadic tests over the years but no sustained activity. The data suggests a move towards less frequent nuclear weapons testing, possibly indicating progress in non-proliferation efforts and advancements in simulation technologies that reduce the need for live tests.
The line chart illustrates the share of the population living on less than $5 per day in Australia, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 1820 to 2017. In 1820, a significant majority of the population in all countries except Italy lived under this threshold, with Australia having the highest share at 90.31%. Over the years, there has been a dramatic decrease in the share of the population living under $5 per day in all countries. By 2017, the share had fallen to near negligible levels in all countries, with Australia at 0.00006%, Italy at 0.00107%, Japan at 0.00002%, the United Kingdom at 0.00015%, and the United States at 0.00223%. The trend is consistently downward across all countries, indicating substantial improvements in the economic conditions of the populations over the nearly two-century span. Notably, the share of the population living under $5 per day in the United States dropped from 58.55% in 1820 to 0.00223% in 2017, showing a significant reduction in poverty levels over time. The data suggests that economic growth and development have led to a substantial decrease in poverty levels, measured by this income threshold, in these countries.
The line chart illustrates the share of global annual CO₂ emissions from flaring for Djibouti, Switzerland, and the world from 1950 to 2022. Djibouti has consistently had a 0% share, indicating no CO₂ emissions from flaring during this period. Switzerland's share was also 0% until 1990 when it started at 0.01%, gradually increasing to a peak of 0.013% in 2010 before declining to 0.005% in 2022. In contrast, the world's share has remained at 100% throughout the entire timeline, suggesting that all CO₂ emissions from flaring globally are included in this data. This highlights that while individual countries like Switzerland may have a small share of emissions from flaring, when aggregated at the global level, these emissions are a significant part of total CO₂ emissions from flaring.
The bar chart presents data on the number of pacemaker implantations per million people for various countries in different years. France leads with the highest rate of 1010.1 implantations in 2019, followed closely by Sweden with 1038.2 implantations also in 2019. Italy and Greece also have high rates, with 949.0 and 895.8 implantations respectively in 2019. On the lower end of the spectrum, Algeria reported 64.4 implantations in 2014, while Turkey had the lowest rate of 139.0 implantations in 2019 among the countries listed. The data suggests significant variation in the rate of pacemaker implantations across different countries, which could potentially reflect differences in healthcare practices, access to medical procedures, or prevalence of conditions requiring such interventions. It's important to note that the data varies by year for each country, which could influence the comparability of the figures. The chart highlights the need for further investigation into the underlying causes of these disparities.

Overall, the trend for most countries except Chad shows a decrease in the share of cereals allocated to human food over the observed period.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the burden of disease, measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and GDP per capita for various countries and regions in 2019. DALYs represent the total burden of disease, including years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with a disability. The plot shows that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have lower DALYs rates, indicating better health outcomes. For instance, countries like Germany, Ireland, and the United States with high GDP per capita values (over $50,000) have DALYs rates below 30,000. In contrast, countries with lower GDP per capita, such as the Central African Republic, Chad, and Niger, exhibit much higher DALYs rates, exceeding 80,000. The size of the circles represents the population of each entity, with larger circles indicating a larger population. The plot also categorizes countries by continent, with African and some Asian countries generally showing higher DALYs rates and lower GDP per capita. The United States stands out with a high GDP per capita of over $60,000 and a moderate DALYs rate of approximately 26,061. The plot suggests a general trend where wealthier nations have better health outcomes, but there are exceptions to this rule, such as Japan and Germany with high GDPs and relatively low DALYs rates.
The line chart illustrates the average price on emissions covered by an emissions trading system (ETS), weighted by the share of each country's CO₂ emissions, for Albania, Cuba, and Malta from 1989 to 2021. Albania and Cuba have consistently had an average price of 0.0 throughout the period, indicating no carbon pricing within emissions trading systems. Malta, on the other hand, shows a different trend. It had an average price of 0.0 until 2005 when it introduced a carbon price at approximately 26.13 EUR. The price then decreased to about 14.66 EUR in 2010 and further to 5.03 EUR in 2015. By 2021, Malta's average carbon price had increased to around 27.90 EUR. This data suggests that Malta has implemented a carbon tax within its emissions trading system, with fluctuations in the price over the years. Notably, Malta's carbon price increased significantly from 2015 to 2021.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between income inequality and GDP per capita for various countries and regions in 2019. Income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient, where values closer to 1 indicate higher inequality. The plot shows that countries with higher GDP per capita do not necessarily have lower Gini coefficients, indicating that wealth disparity can be high even in relatively wealthy nations. For instance, the United States has a high GDP per capita of over $60,000 but a Gini coefficient of approximately 0.415, suggesting significant income inequality. In contrast, countries like Kiribati and Malawi, with lower GDP per capita, exhibit lower Gini coefficients, implying less income inequality. The size of the circles represents the population of each entity, with larger circles indicating more populous countries. The plot also categorizes countries by continent and includes aggregate data for continents, such as Africa and Asia, with their respective population sizes. The data suggests that income inequality is a complex issue influenced by various factors beyond just GDP per capita.
The chart presents the intensity of multidimensional poverty in various countries from 2000 to 2019. Multidimensional poverty refers to the deprivations in health, education, and living standards indicators. Gabon started with an intensity of 46.98% in 2000, while Serbia showed a decrease from 42.65% in 2010 to 38.10% in 2019. Mali had the highest intensity recorded on the chart at 57.13% in 2015. China's data point in 2010 indicates an intensity of 43.21%. Sao Tome and Principe had an intensity of 41.31% in 2019. The chart shows a general trend of decreasing intensity in multidimensional poverty over time for the countries with multiple data points, suggesting improvements in the indicators used to measure poverty. However, the chart also includes countries with only one data point, such as Gabon and Mali, which do not allow for the observation of trends over time. The data points are harmonized over time to allow for comparisons between countries and over time within countries.
The bar chart presents the number of ongoing wars in the world categorized by conflict type from 1800 to 2011. Civil wars are distinguished from other types of conflicts (non-civil). In 1800, there was one non-civil war and no civil wars. The number of civil wars increased to 3 by 1816, while non-civil wars decreased to 3. By 1920, the number of civil wars peaked at 4, with non-civil wars at 8. The chart shows a significant spike in civil wars in 1992, with 6 recorded, while non-civil wars were at a low of 1. The data indicates that the number of civil wars has generally been higher than non-civil wars, with notable peaks in civil wars in 1816, 1864, and 1992. The chart also reveals periods with relatively few conflicts, such as between 1960 and 1976, and a general decline in the number of ongoing wars by 2011, with only 1 civil war reported. The data suggests that the nature of conflicts has evolved over time, with periods of higher incidence of civil wars.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between fertility rates and female labor force participation across various countries and regions for the year 2021. Fertility rate, which indicates the average number of children per woman, is plotted against the female labor force participation rate, which shows the percentage of the female population aged 15 and older who are economically active. The plot reveals a general trend where higher female labor force participation is associated with lower fertility rates. For instance, countries like San Marino and Iceland, which have high female labor force participation rates (87.59% and 69.27%, respectively), also have lower fertility rates (1.1297 and 1.7329, respectively). Conversely, countries with lower female labor force participation, such as Iraq (10.77%), often have higher fertility rates (3.4955). The size of the circles represents the population of each entity, with larger circles indicating a larger population. High-income countries are clustered in the center with moderate fertility rates (1.5605) and female labor force participation (53.86%). The plot also includes continents, with Africa and Asia having the largest populations, represented by the largest circles, but their specific fertility and labor force participation rates are not provided. Overall, the data suggests a negative correlation between female labor force participation and fertility rates, implying that as women participate more in the labor force, they have fewer children on average.
The bar chart presents data on the risk of impoverishing expenditure for surgical care in 2020 for various entities. Impoverishing expenditure refers to direct out-of-pocket payments for surgical and anesthesia care that can drive people below the extreme poverty threshold. Lesotho had the highest risk at 38.6%, indicating that a significant portion of its population is at risk of falling into poverty due to surgical expenses. Lower-middle-income countries collectively had a risk of 25.01%, which was notably higher than individual countries like China and Sri Lanka, which had risks of 6.1% and 14.8%, respectively. Turkmenistan and Turkey had relatively low risks at 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively. This data highlights significant disparities in the risk of financial hardship related to surgical care across different income levels and countries.
The scatter plot illustrates the alcohol consumption per capita for men and women aged 15 years and older within a calendar year, measured in liters of pure alcohol for the year 2019. Each point represents a country, with the male consumption on the x-axis and the female consumption on the y-axis. The size of the circles corresponds to the population of the country. Romania has the highest male alcohol consumption at 27.3 liters, while Indonesia has the lowest at 0.19 liters. In contrast, female consumption is lowest in Indonesia at 0.03 liters and highest in Romania at 7.51 liters. The United States stands out with a significant male consumption of 15.03 liters and a female consumption of 4.29 liters. The plot also shows a general trend where male alcohol consumption is higher than female consumption for most countries. The data suggests considerable variation in alcohol consumption habits between countries and genders. The chart also categorizes countries by continent, with African and Asian countries generally showing lower consumption rates for both genders compared to European and some South American countries, which tend to have higher consumption rates. The highest consumption rates are observed in countries like Czechia, Georgia, and Romania for males, and in countries like Romania, Czechia, and the United States for females. The data highlights the diversity in alcohol consumption patterns across the globe.
The line chart illustrates the cumulative installed wind energy capacity, including both onshore and offshore sources, for selected countries from 2000 to 2022, measured in gigawatts (GW).

Spain's wind energy capacity grew steadily from 2.206 GW in 2000 to 29.307837 GW in 2022. Australia's capacity saw a remarkable rise from 0.033 GW in 2000 to 10.134001 GW in 2022. Italy's growth was more modest, from 0.363 GW in 2000 to 11.779734 GW in 2022. Japan's wind energy capacity experienced a slower growth rate, starting at 0.084 GW in 2000 and reaching 4.577 GW in 2022. The chart indicates a general upward trend in wind energy capacity for all countries, with Germany having the highest capacity by a significant margin. The data suggests a global trend towards investing in renewable energy sources, particularly wind energy.
The line chart presents the annual number of deaths from all types of falls in Equatorial Guinea and Kenya from 1990 to 2019. In Equatorial Guinea, the number of deaths started at 16 in 1990 and showed a gradual increase, reaching 30 deaths by 2019. In contrast, Kenya began with a significantly higher number of 600 deaths in 1990 and experienced a steady and more pronounced rise, culminating in 1538 deaths by 2019. The chart clearly indicates that the number of deaths from falls in Kenya is substantially higher than in Equatorial Guinea throughout the entire period. The overall trend for both countries is an increase in the number of deaths due to falls over the 29-year span. However, the rate of increase is much greater for Kenya compared to Equatorial Guinea.
The area chart illustrates the trends in fish landings and discards in Liberia from 1966 to 2018. Fish landings, which represent the aquatic animals caught and brought ashore for use, have seen significant fluctuations over the years. Starting at 13,993.87 tonnes in 1966, there was a notable increase to 25,497.15 tonnes in 1970. However, by 1980, landings peaked at 28,938.06 tonnes before experiencing a steep decline to 11,398.33 tonnes in 1990. After a brief recovery to 12,920.88 tonnes in 2000, landings surged to 32,099.15 tonnes in 2010, marking the highest recorded level. The latest available data from 2018 shows landings at 27,832.76 tonnes. Discards, on the other hand, have been much lower in comparison. The only recorded discards were in 1966 at 627.23 tonnes, which then dropped dramatically to zero by 2018. This suggests a near-complete elimination of discards in recent years, which is a positive development in fisheries management. The chart also indicates that from 1990 onwards, landings have consistently been higher than discards, indicating a trend towards greater fish catch for utilization rather than being thrown back into the sea.
The line chart illustrates the treatment success rate for new and relapse tuberculosis cases across various countries from 1994 to 2021.

Belgium's rail passenger-kilometers increased from about 6.76 billion in 1995 to around 10.33 billion in 2015. Belarus experienced a peak in 2000 with about 17.72 billion passenger-kilometers, followed by a decline to around 6.22 billion by 2018. Norway's figures grew from approximately 2.68 billion in 1995 to around 4.32 billion in 2015. Bangladesh showed a steady increase from about 4.04 billion in 1995 to around 8.71 billion in 2015. Syria's data is less consistent, with a significant drop to around 0.19 billion in 2000, followed by an increase to approximately 1.86 billion in 2010. Overall, the chart indicates a general increase in rail passenger-kilometers for most of the countries listed, with China showing the most dramatic growth.
The line chart illustrates the percentage change in mangrove total area in Benin from 2007 to 2020, relative to the baseline extent of mangroves in 2000. Initially, there was a significant decrease in mangrove area, with -17.9% recorded in 2007, which further dropped to -21.53% in 2008. However, by 2010, the rate of decline had slowed to -7.2%. Interestingly, from 2010 onwards, there was a positive change in mangrove area, with a growth of 1.69% in 2016 and 0.99% in 2018. However, this growth did not last, and by 2020, there was a slight reduction in mangrove area change at -1.19%. Overall, despite the periods of growth after 2010, the data shows a net loss in mangrove area over the entire period, with the most significant losses occurring in the first two years (2007 and 2008).
The line chart illustrates the death rate per 100,000 people for all causes across both sexes and all age groups in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, and Mexico from 2000 to 2019. Afghanistan's death rate showed a consistent decline from 1.18952 in 2000 to 0.67055 in 2019. Bangladesh also experienced a decrease in death rates, starting at 0.67693 in 2000 and slightly increasing from its lowest point of 0.4727 in 2015 to 0.4866 in 2019. China's death rate was relatively stable, with a minor peak in 2005 at 0.68129 and a slight increase from 2015 to 2019, reaching 0.70139. Mexico's death rate, on the other hand, showed an overall upward trend, starting at 0.46332 in 2000 and rising to 0.55618 in 2019. The chart indicates a general improvement in life expectancy in Afghanistan and Bangladesh, while Mexico's population is experiencing an increase in the death rate over the two decades. China's death rate remained fairly constant with only minor fluctuations.
The chart illustrates the implementation of civil registers in four different countries—Egypt, Haiti, Norway, and Venezuela—from 1750 to 2015. Civil registers are crucial for recording key life events such as births, marriages, and deaths. Norway has consistently had a civil register in place since 1750, indicating a strong tradition in record-keeping. In contrast, Egypt did not implement a civil register until 1950, after which it remained in use through 2015. Haiti also did not establish a civil register until 2015. Venezuela shows an intermediate pattern, with no civil register until 1900, but then maintaining one from 1900 onwards. The data suggests a variation in the adoption of civil registers across different countries, with some having established systems for centuries while others are only recently implementing such measures.
The bar chart presents the number of deaths from volcanic eruptions worldwide from 1570 to 2017. It shows significant variability over time, with some years experiencing substantially higher death tolls than others. For instance, the year 1672 recorded the highest number of deaths within this period, with a total of 3,003 fatalities. Another notable peak is seen in 1638, with 1,001 deaths. However, the data also indicates that in recent years, the number of deaths from volcanic eruptions has generally been lower. For example, the years 1893, 1910, 1927, and several years thereafter show very low or zero deaths attributed to volcanic eruptions. There is a noticeable spike in 1944 with 147 deaths, but this is an outlier compared to the overall trend. The data for more recent years like 2017 shows a relatively low number of deaths (19) once again, reflecting a possible improvement in early warning systems, evacuation procedures, or other factors that could reduce the number of fatalities from volcanic events. The chart suggests a general decline in the number of deaths from volcanic eruptions over the last few centuries, with the most severe events occurring predominantly in the 17th century.
The bar chart presents the percentage change in average male height for those born in 1996 compared to those born in 1896 across various countries. Turkey exhibits the highest increase at 8.66%, followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina with an increase of 7.39%. Other notable increases include Chile at 6.92% and Mauritius at 6.14%. Brunei shows a moderate rise of 5.92%, while Ethiopia's increase is more modest at 3.07%. Rwanda has the smallest increase among the listed countries at just 1.71%. The data suggests significant variations in the change in male height across different countries, with some experiencing double-digit percentage increases and others much less.
The line chart illustrates the prevalence rate of cardiovascular diseases per 100,000 people, age-standardized for both sexes, in various countries and globally from 1990 to 2019. Egypt experienced a steady increase from 8.77 cases in 1990 to 9.28 cases in 2019. Iraq's prevalence initially decreased from 9.08 cases in 1990 to 8.72 cases in 2019, with a slight dip around 2005. Lithuania's rate fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, starting at 7.25 cases in 1990 and slightly decreasing to 7.17 cases in 2019. The United Kingdom showed a significant decline from 6.95 cases in 1990 to 5.55 cases in 2019. The United States saw a decrease from 1990 to 2015, from 8.86 to 7.51 cases, before a slight increase to 7.62 cases in 2019. The global prevalence rate (World) also decreased from 6.73 cases in 1990 to 6.43 cases in 2019. Overall, the United Kingdom demonstrated the most substantial decline, while Egypt showed the highest increase among the observed entities.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the number of new tetanus cases per 100,000 people and the percentage of one-year-olds immunized with the DTP3 vaccine across various countries in 2019. A general trend can be observed where countries with higher vaccination coverage tend to have lower rates of tetanus cases. For instance, Albania and Andorra have close to 100% vaccination coverage and very low tetanus case rates, while countries like Chad and Somalia have lower vaccination rates and significantly higher tetanus case rates, with Somalia having the highest number of cases at over 20 per 100,000 people. The scatter plot also highlights the disparities between different continents, with African countries generally showing higher case rates and lower vaccination coverage, while European and some South American countries exhibit higher vaccination rates and lower case numbers. The data suggests a positive correlation between vaccination coverage and the reduction of tetanus cases, indicating the effectiveness of vaccination programs in combating this disease.
