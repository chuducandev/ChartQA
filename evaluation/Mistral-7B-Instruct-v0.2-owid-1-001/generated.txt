In 1820, a significant majority of the world's population, approximately 794.51 million people, were living in extreme poverty, while 206.59 million were not. Over the next 130 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty decreased, with some regions, such as Western Europe and North America, achieving substantial progress in reducing poverty. By 1950, the number of people not in extreme poverty had risen to about 1.18 billion, while those in extreme poverty were approximately 1.35 billion. The trend continued, and by 1981, the number of people not in extreme poverty had more than doubled to around 2.53 billion. The year 2000 saw further progress, with 4.50 billion people not in extreme poverty. The most recent data from 2018 shows a significant decline in extreme poverty, with 6.74 billion people living above the poverty line, compared to 674.18 million in extreme poverty. This represents a substantial reduction in extreme poverty over the past two centuries, with the gap between the impoverished and the non-impoverished widening in favor of the latter.
The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the share of the population living in poverty and the average years of education for the youth and adult population aged 15-64 across various countries and regions in 2019. Each point represents a country or region, with the size of the circle indicating the population size. The vertical axis measures the share of the population living in poverty, defined as living below $3.65 per day, while the horizontal axis shows the average years of education. Countries like Malawi and Mozambique are positioned towards the left, indicating a high share of the population living in poverty, with over 89% and 88.6% respectively, and relatively low education levels. In contrast, countries like Russia and Ukraine are positioned towards the right, with very low shares of the population living in poverty, less than 1%, and higher education levels. The United States is positioned near the bottom right, with a very low share of the population in poverty, around 1.25%, and high education levels. The chart also shows continental aggregates, with Africa and Asia having the largest population sizes, but the specific educational attainment and poverty levels are not provided for these continents.

1. Introduction: The line chart illustrates the trend in the total disease burden in France from the year 2000 to 2019, measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for all causes and both sexes across all age groups. 2. Overview: The total disease burden is calculated by adding the number of years lost due to premature death and years lived with a disability. One DALY represents one lost year of healthy life. 3. Trend: The chart shows a gradual increase in the total disease burden over the 19-year period. In 2000, France experienced a disease burden of approximately 16.7 million DALYs. This figure remained relatively stable through 2005, with a slight increase to around 16.8 million DALYs in 2010. A more notable rise is observed in 2015, with the burden reaching approximately 17.1 million DALYs, and it continued to increase, reaching about 17.3 million DALYs by 2019. This upward trend indicates a growing impact of disease on the population's health, with more years lost to illness and disability each year.
The scatter plot compares adult female literacy rates from two different sources for the year 2018: DHS Surveys and UNESCO. Each point represents a country, with the position along the x-axis indicating the literacy rate according to UNESCO, and the position along the y-axis showing the rate according to DHS Surveys. The size of each circle corresponds to the population of the country, with larger circles indicating more populous countries. The data reveals a wide range of literacy rates, with some countries like Indonesia and Gabon showing high literacy rates above 90% according to both sources, while others like Niger and Mali have much lower rates, with Niger having a literacy rate as low as 26.65% according to UNESCO. The plot also shows a general trend where countries with higher literacy rates according to UNESCO also tend to have higher rates according to DHS Surveys. However, there are exceptions, such as India, which has a literacy rate of 65.79% according to DHS Surveys but is not shown on the plot as it falls below the threshold of literacy rates that UNESCO reports. The chart also color-codes continents, indicating that African countries predominantly occupy the lower left portion of the plot, while Asian countries are spread across a wider range of literacy rates.

The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between self-reported happiness and life satisfaction in various countries for the year 2022. Happiness is measured by the share of people who report being'very happy' or 'rather happy,' while life satisfaction is assessed through the Cantril ladder score. The plot shows a wide range of happiness levels, with some countries like Iceland and Finland reporting very high happiness levels (above 90%) and high life satisfaction scores (above 80). In contrast, Lebanon has the lowest reported happiness (around 25%) and life satisfaction score (around 86). The size of the circles represents the population of each country, with larger circles indicating a larger population. Notably, populous countries like China and India have moderate happiness levels (around 88% and 80%, respectively) with high life satisfaction scores (around 88% and 80%, respectively). The data suggests that there is no simple correlation between population size and reported happiness or life satisfaction, with some small and large countries spread across the spectrum of happiness and life satisfaction.

However, by 2000, it rose to 1.12%, and by 2010 it reached 3.04%, with a slight increase to 3.86% by 2019.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the death rate from indoor air pollution and GDP per capita for various countries in 2019. Each point represents a country, with the x-axis showing GDP per capita (PPP, constant 2017 international $) and the y-axis showing the death rate from indoor air pollution per 100,000 people. The size of the circles indicates the population of the country. Notably, countries with lower GDP per capita tend to have higher death rates from indoor air pollution. For instance, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Somalia show high death rates exceeding 250 per 100,000 people with GDPs per capita below $5,000. In contrast, wealthier countries like Australia, Bermuda, and the United States have very low death rates from indoor air pollution, with GDPs per capita above $40,000. The data suggests a correlation between economic prosperity and the prevalence of indoor air pollution-related health issues.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the annual average growth of trade as a share of GDP and GDP per capita for various countries and regions from 1945 to 2014. Trade is expressed in exports as a share of GDP. GDP per capita is adjusted for inflation and differences in the cost of living between countries. The size of the circles represents the population of each entity. Notably, Congo and Vietnam show a high trade-to-GDP ratio, with Congo reaching over 73% and Vietnam close to 86% in 2014. On the other hand, Ethiopia and Uganda have a much lower ratio, both under 5% in 2014. The chart also indicates that generally, as GDP per capita increases, the trade-to-GDP ratio tends to decrease, suggesting a possible decoupling of trade from economic growth as countries develop. However, there are exceptions to this trend, such as Ireland and the Netherlands, which maintain a high trade-to-GDP ratio even with higher GDP per capita. The data also reveals regional disparities, with African and Asian countries generally showing higher trade-to-GDP ratios compared to European and North American countries with similar GDP per capita.
The bubble chart illustrates the relationship between the average working hours of children aged 7-14 and the percentage of children in employment in various countries and regions for the year 2016. The vertical axis shows the percentage of children in employment, while the horizontal axis indicates the average weekly working hours. Notably, Jordan has the highest percentage of children in employment at 20.02%, with an average of 15.54 hours worked per week. In contrast, countries like Chile and Ukraine show very low percentages of children in employment, at 0.0% and 0.01% respectively. The chart also reveals that countries with higher percentages of children in employment tend to have a higher average of working hours. For instance, Bangladesh has a high percentage of 10.05% of children in employment, with an average of 20.0 hours worked per week. In comparison, the Democratic Republic of Congo has a lower percentage of 1.0% of children in employment, with an average of 10.0 hours worked per week. The size of the bubbles represents the population of the country or region, with larger bubbles indicating more populous areas. The chart effectively highlights the correlation between child labor and the average working hours of children in different parts of the world.
The line chart illustrates the percentage of government expenditure dedicated to interest payments from 1972 to 2020 for the Marshall Islands and Switzerland. For the Marshall Islands, interest payments as a share of expense decreased from 1.02% in 2010 to 0.46% in 2020. Switzerland's trend shows a significant fluctuation over the years. Starting at 2.04% in 1972, there was a steady increase peaking at 4.19% in 2000. After 2000, there was a notable decline, with the percentage falling to 2.76% in 2010 and further decreasing to 0.68% in 2020. The chart indicates a general downward trend in the proportion of government expenditures going towards interest payments for both countries, with the most substantial reduction observed in the last decade for Switzerland.
The line chart illustrates the decline in the global infant mortality rate for both females and males from 1990 to 2021. In 1990, the infant mortality rate for females was approximately 6.05 deaths per 100 live births, which steadily decreased to about 2.61 by 2021. Similarly, the rate for males started at roughly 6.84 deaths per 100 live births in 1990 and followed a downward trend to approximately 3.06 by 2021. Throughout the years, the mortality rate for males has consistently been higher than for females. The overall trend shows a significant improvement in infant survival rates for both sexes over the three-decade period.
The chart presents the democratic electoral institutions scores for Argentina, Australia, Botswana, and China from 2005 to 2022, based on Freedom House assessments. Argentina and Botswana both consistently score 11, indicating stable democratic electoral processes, while Australia maintains the highest score of 12, suggesting a consistently strong democratic electoral system. In contrast, China consistently scores 0, indicating a lack of democratic electoral institutions according to the Freedom House criteria. The scores reflect the extent to which the chief executive and legislature are chosen in free and fair elections under universal suffrage, with a range from 0 to 12, where 12 represents the most democratic.
The line chart illustrates the share of global annual CO₂ emissions from flaring by Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 1950 to 2022. In 1950, the United States had a dominant share of 58.57% of global CO₂ emissions from flaring, which significantly dropped to 34.01% by 1960. The United States experienced fluctuations in subsequent decades, with a notable dip to 2.11% in 1980, followed by an increase to 17.91% in 1990, and a decrease again to 11.21% in 2000. By 2010, the share rose to 12.71%, and in 2022, it was 15.92%. Europe's share was zero in both 1950 and 1960 but increased to 1.19% by 1970, peaking at 26.65% in 1990, then decreasing to 21.25% by 2022. The United Kingdom's share was also zero in both 1950 and 1960, with a gradual increase to 2.54% in 1980, followed by a decrease to 0.81% by 2022. The chart shows that while the United States' share of CO₂ emissions from flaring has generally decreased over the years, both Europe and the United Kingdom have seen increases, with Europe's share being the most significant in recent decades.
The line chart illustrates the trend in median age for various countries from 1950 to projected values in 2100 based on the UN medium-fertility scenario. In 1950, Japan had the highest median age at 21.2 years, followed by the United Kingdom at 33.9 years. By 2020, Japan's median age increased to 48.0 years, and the United Kingdom saw an increase to 39.5 years. Projections suggest that by 2100, Japan's median age will reach 54.4 years, while the United Kingdom will reach 49.2 years. The United States started with a median age of 29.3 years in 1950 and is projected to reach 47.3 years by 2100. China and India, which had lower median ages in 1950 (22.2 and 20.0 years respectively), saw significant increases by 2020 (37.4 and 27.3 years respectively). Projections indicate that by 2100, China's median age will reach 56.8 years, while India's will reach 47.5 years. Brazil and Nigeria, starting with lower median ages of 17.5 and 18.1 years respectively in 1950, are projected to reach 50.4 and 34.5 years by 2100. Russia's median age is expected to rise from 35.6 years in 2000 to 46.2 years by 2100.
The line chart illustrates the global trend in the under-fifteen mortality rate from 1990 to 2021. The mortality rate, measured as deaths per 100 live births, has shown a consistent decline over the three decades. In 1990, the mortality rate was approximately 10.62 deaths per 100 live births. This rate saw a gradual decrease, reaching about 9.88 deaths per 100 live births in 1995, and further declining to around 8.64 deaths per 100 live births by the year 2000. The trend continued, with the mortality rate dropping to approximately 7.24 deaths per 100 live births in 2005, and then to roughly 5.96 deaths per 100 live births by 2010. The decline persisted, reaching about 5.02 deaths per 100 live births in 2015, and ultimately, the data shows a significant reduction to around 4.40 deaths per 100 live births by 2021. This substantial decrease suggests improvements in factors affecting child health globally.
The area chart illustrates the political regime changes in South America from 1789 to 2022, categorized by types of political systems: closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, and liberal democracies of varying ages. In 1789, South America was dominated by closed autocracies, with 4 countries. By 1850, electoral autocracies emerged, coexisting with closed autocracies (8 countries). The year 1900 saw the first electoral democracy in South America, with 8 countries having this regime. A significant shift occurred by 1950, with the rise of electoral democracies (2 countries) and a decline in closed autocracies (5 countries). The turn of the millennium in 2000 marked a notable transition, with no closed autocracies and 9 electoral democracies. The chart shows a persistence of electoral democracies (9 countries) in 2018 and 2022, with the emergence of liberal democracies aged 1-18 years (1 country in 2018 and 2022) and 30-60 years (1 country in 2018). There were no liberal democracies aged 91+ years in the data provided. The chart underscores the evolution of South America's political landscape, moving from autocratic to democratic regimes over the centuries, with a notable increase in democratic forms since the 20th century.
The line chart illustrates the income share of the richest decile before taxes from 1910 to 2021 in China, France, South Africa, and the United States. In 1980, China had the lowest income share for the richest decile at 27.89%, which increased to 35.87% by 2000. France's share started at a high of 51.84% in 1910, decreasing over time to 31.279999% in 1980 and slightly rising to 33.25% in 2000. South Africa had a high share of 53.49% in 2000. The United States saw an increase from 44.14% in 1920 to 48.94% in 1940, followed by a decrease to 33.85% in 1980, and then a rise to 42.75% in 2000, reaching 45.6% by 2021. The chart shows a general trend of increasing income share for the richest decile in China and the United States, while France experienced a decline over the century.
2015 saw a variation in the annual change in forest area relative to GDP per capita across different countries. The change in forest area is indicative of reforestation or net deforestation, with negative values suggesting deforestation. Notably, Bahrain had the highest rate of deforestation at 3.33%, while Malawi experienced the most significant reforestation with a 1.71% increase. GDP per capita data shows that countries with higher economic output did not necessarily have a positive change in forest area. For instance, Singapore, with one of the highest GDPs per capita at $89,160.73, had a deforestation rate of -1.09%. In contrast, countries with lower GDPs per capita, such as Somalia and Malawi, had negative changes in forest area, indicating deforestation. The scatter plot also reveals that countries from different continents are spread across the plot, with no clear trend indicating a correlation between GDP per capita and forest area change.
The line chart illustrates the percentage of children aged 7-14 in employment in Nepal, segregated by sex, between 1999 and 2014. In 1999, a higher percentage of female children were employed (52.4%) compared to male children (42.2%). By 2008, there was a decrease in the employment of both male (36.2%) and female children (45.4%). However, by 2014, the employment rates had risen again, with a slightly higher percentage of male children (41.5%) compared to female children (44.1%). Throughout the period, female children consistently had higher employment rates than male children in Nepal.
The line chart illustrates the treatment of hazardous waste in tonnes by type of treatment, including recycling, incineration, landfilling, and other types of waste management for Croatia and Cuba from 2000 to 2020. For Croatia, there was a significant increase in recycling from about 1.87 million tonnes in 2010 to approximately 2.57 million tonnes in 2020. In contrast, incineration and landfilling saw a decrease, with incineration dropping to zero tonnes in 2020 from 4,573 tonnes in 2010, and landfilling decreasing to 3,497 tonnes from 8,793 tonnes. Cuba showed a different trend with a substantial rise in landfilling from about 124,210 tonnes in 2010 to 137,887 tonnes in 2015, while incineration also increased to 25,718 tonnes from 16,924 tonnes in 2010. Recycling figures for Cuba were lower, starting at 6,956 tonnes in 2010 and reaching 20,492 tonnes in 2015. The data does not include recycling figures for Cuba in 2020.

The area chart illustrates the age dependency breakdown by young and old dependents on the global population from 1950 to 2021. Two dependencies are tracked: the old-age dependency ratio, which measures the ratio of older populations (aged over 64 years) to the working-age population (15-64 years), and the child dependency ratio, which measures the ratio of children aged 0-14 years to the working-age population. Over the years, there has been a noticeable increase in the old-age dependency ratio, from 8.53 in 1950 to 14.83 in 2021. Conversely, the child dependency ratio has shown a steady decline, starting at 57.71 in 1950 and decreasing to 39.26 by 2021. This suggests a significant demographic shift towards an older population worldwide, with fewer young dependents relative to the working-age population. The chart also highlights the relative size of each dependency category, with the old-age dependency ratio being consistently larger than the child dependency ratio throughout the period.
The line chart illustrates the age-standardized death rate from tuberculosis per 100,000 people in Tanzania from 1990 to 2019.

The line chart illustrates the trend in global oil proved reserves from 1980 to 2020. Proved reserves refer to the quantity of oil that can be recovered in the future under existing economic and operating conditions. The data shows a consistent increase in reserves over the 40-year period. In 1980, the world's oil proved reserves were approximately 93.11 billion tonnes. This figure saw a gradual rise, reaching about 105.61 billion tonnes in 1985. The growth in reserves accelerated, with reserves touching roughly 136.52 billion tonnes in 1990. The increase continued, with reserves reaching approximately 149.86 billion tonnes in 1995. The new millennium marked a significant jump, as reserves surged to around 177.45 billion tonnes by the year 2000. The growth persisted, with reserves climbing to nearly 187.21 billion tonnes in 2005. The ascent in reserves plateaued somewhat in the 21st century, with reserves standing at approximately 223.27 billion tonnes in 2010 and reaching about 229.68 billion tonnes by 2015. By 2020, the global oil proved reserves reached their highest point at around 236.29 billion tonnes. This data indicates that despite the consistent depletion of reserves as we extract oil, new resources are continually being discovered or become economically viable to extract, maintaining a growing total of proven reserves over time.

However, there have been several downturns, with the most dramatic being in 2021 where the growth dropped to -37.25%, indicating a substantial contraction in capital formation. The years 1980 and 2010 also saw negative growth rates of -15.25% and -13.14% respectively. The data reflects the varying economic conditions Ireland has navigated, with periods of both expansion and contraction in capital formation.
The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between child mortality rates and the percentage of children under age five with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) taken to a healthcare provider in various countries and regions for the year 2021. Child mortality is measured as the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five. The plot shows a general trend where countries with higher rates of ARI treatment at a healthcare provider also tend to have lower child mortality rates. For instance, India has a high ARI treatment percentage of 69% and a child mortality rate of 3.06%. In contrast, Nigeria has the highest reported child mortality rate of 11.08% but does not provide data on ARI treatment. African countries predominantly occupy the higher end of both child mortality and ARI treatment percentages. The data for Europe, North America, and Oceania indicate relatively low child mortality rates and ARI treatment percentages. The continent-wise data for Europe and North America show very low child mortality rates, with Europe at 0.44 deaths per 100 live births and North America at 0.61. The data for South Africa and Zimbabwe also show lower rates of child mortality and ARI treatment compared to many African countries.

The scatter plot compares the per capita consumption-based CO₂ emissions to the territorial CO₂ emissions per capita for various countries in 2021. Consumption-based emissions include those from fossil fuels and industry, while territorial emissions are those produced within a country's borders. High-income countries like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have both high consumption-based and territorial CO₂ emissions per capita, with Qatar reaching approximately 26.7 tonnes and the United Arab Emirates around 39.8 tonnes. In contrast, low-income countries such as Ethiopia and Mozambique have very low emissions, with Ethiopia at about 0.18 tonnes and Mozambique at 0.22 tonnes. The size of the circles represents the share of world population for each country, with high-income countries having a significantly larger share compared to lower-income countries. Upper-middle-income countries, despite having moderate emissions, account for a substantial portion of the world's population. The plot also indicates that countries above the diagonal line are net importers of CO₂, while those below are net exporters.
The scatter plot illustrates the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders per 100 people in males versus females across various countries and continents for the year 2019. Each point represents a country or continent, with the horizontal axis showing the percentage of females with autism spectrum disorders and the vertical axis showing the percentage of males. The United Kingdom and the United States are notable outliers, with males having a significantly higher prevalence (1.26% and 1.04%, respectively) compared to females (0.22% and 0.24%, respectively). In contrast, countries like Taiwan and South Korea show a lower prevalence in both genders (0.35% and 0.25% for males, 0.08% and 0.25% for females, respectively). The size of the circles corresponds to the population of the entity, with larger circles indicating a larger population. The data suggests that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders is generally higher in males than in females and that there are substantial variations between countries and continents.
