By 2022, the population under autocracies had increased to about 2.9 billion, while the populations under flawed democracies and full democracies decreased, with flawed democracies at around 2.9 billion and full democracies at approximately 631 million. Notably, the population living in hybrid regimes increased significantly from 755 million in 2006 to 1.4 billion in 2022. Populations living under people not registered under any regime also grew from 33 million in 2006 to 440 million in 2022. The data indicates a concerning rise in the population living under autocracies and hybrid regimes over the 16-year period, while populations living in full and flawed democracies have decreased.
The area chart depicts the global trend in the share of the population living in extreme poverty from 1820 to 2018. Extreme poverty is defined as living below the International Poverty Line of $1.90 per day. In 1820, a significant majority of the world's population, approximately 794.51 million people, lived in extreme poverty, while only about 206.59 million were not. Over the next 130 years, the number of people in poverty continued to grow, with those not in poverty remaining a relatively small proportion of the total. By 1950, the number of people in poverty had increased to approximately 1.347 billion, and the number not in poverty had risen to about 1.179 billion. The turn of the millennium marked a turning point in the trend, with the number of people not in poverty (4.503 billion) surpassing those in poverty (1.627 billion) for the first time. The gap continued to widen, and by 2018, the number of people not in poverty had increased dramatically to approximately 7.152 billion, while those in poverty decreased to about 674.18 million. This significant shift reflects the worldwide efforts to reduce extreme poverty over the last two centuries.
The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between educational attainment and poverty levels across various countries and continents for the year 2019. Poverty is measured as the share of the population living below $3.65 per day, and educational attainment is represented by the average number of years of total schooling for the population aged 15-64. The chart reveals a diverse pattern of educational outcomes and poverty levels. For instance, countries like India and Niger have a high poverty rate of over 45% with varying educational attainment, while countries like Australia and Brazil show lower poverty rates of 10.75% and 13.72%, respectively, with higher educational attainment. The plot also indicates continental differences, with African countries generally having higher poverty rates and lower educational attainment, while European countries tend to have lower poverty rates and higher educational attainment. The United States, for example, has a high educational attainment but a relatively low poverty rate of 1.25%. The data suggests that while educational attainment can be a factor in reducing poverty, it is not the only determinant, and other economic, social, and political factors likely play a significant role as well.
The line chart illustrates the percentage of school enrollment at the primary education level in private institutions for Estonia, Greece, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the United Kingdom from 1971 to 2021.

The most notable rise occurred between 1950 and 2000, with the average age increasing from 28.262 to 29.752 years. The trend for low-income countries shows a more stable average childbearing age, starting at 29.862 years in 1950 and ending at 28.987 years in 2015. The average age for low-income countries peaked slightly around 1980 at 29.802 years before beginning a gradual decline. Overall, the data indicates that high-income countries have seen a substantial increase in the average age at which women have their first child, whereas low-income countries have not experienced a significant change over the same period.
The line chart presents the age-standardized death rates from cardiovascular diseases per 100,000 people for males and females in the United States across various years. In 1950, the death rate for males was significantly higher at 624.54 compared to females at 444.53. Over the decades, the trend shows a consistent decrease in cardiovascular death rates for both sexes. By 1990, the rates had dropped to 316.95 for males and 191.58 for females. The decline continued into the 21st century, with rates reaching 171.12 for males and 110.48 for females by 2010. The latest data from 2020 indicates a slight decrease to 166.28 for males and 103.47 for females. Throughout the period, the death rate for males has remained notably higher than for females, but the gap has narrowed over time.
The scatter plot compares life expectancy at birth against current health expenditure per capita for various countries and regions in 2019. The horizontal axis shows the percentage of the current international dollar health expenditure per capita, while the vertical axis indicates the life expectancy at birth in years. The plot also color-codes countries by continent. Generally, there is a positive correlation between health expenditure and life expectancy. For instance, Australia and the United States, with higher health expenditures per capita, also have high life expectancies, exceeding 85 years. Conversely, countries with lower health expenditures, like Nigeria and South Sudan, have lower life expectancies, below 60 years. The plot also shows that high-income countries tend to spend more on health, with Germany and the United States spending over $6000 and $10000 respectively, and having high life expectancies of over 80 years. In contrast, lower-income countries such as Afghanistan, Chad, and Niger have both lower health expenditures and life expectancies, with Afghanistan spending less than $200 per capita and having a life expectancy of 63.6 years. The World average life expectancy is 72.8 years, with a health expenditure per capita of $1458.94, indicating a wide range of health expenditure and life expectancy across the globe.

The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the burden of disease, measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and GDP per capita for various countries in 2019. The DALYs represent the total burden of disease, which includes both years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with a disability. Higher GDP per capita does not always correspond with lower DALYs; for instance, the United States has a high GDP per capita but a moderate DALY rate. In contrast, some countries with lower GDP per capita, such as Chad and Nigeria, have very high DALY rates. The plot also highlights continental variations, with African countries generally clustered towards the higher DALY range, while countries from Asia and Europe are spread across the GDP per capita spectrum. The size of the circles corresponds to the population size of each country, with larger circles indicating more populous nations.
The chart presents the average price on emissions covered by an emissions trading system (ETS), weighted by the share of a country's CO₂ emissions, for Albania, Cuba, and Malta from 1989 to 2021. For Albania, the price was at zero until 2010, after which it remained at zero. Cuba's price was also at zero throughout the entire period. Malta, however, shows a different trend. Malta had an initial price of zero in 1989, which remained steady until 2005. From 2005 onwards, there was a significant increase in the price, peaking at 27.895527 in 2021. This peak value for Malta is an outlier compared to the other years, indicating a unique event or policy change that affected Malta's price. The other years for Malta show fluctuations around the 5 to 15 range, suggesting that the price on emissions in Malta was modest and relatively stable until the dramatic increase in 2021.

In contrast, countries with lower GDP per capita, such as Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania, tend to have lower income inequality, with Gini coefficients below 0.4. The size of the circles represents the population of each country, with China and India having notably large populations, but their specific Gini coefficients and GDP per capita are not provided. The chart also indicates continents, with African countries generally showing lower GDP per capita and higher income inequality, while European countries, with the exception of Russia, tend to have higher GDP per capita and varying levels of income inequality.
The line chart illustrates the changes in the intensity of multidimensional poverty among various countries from 2000 to 2019. Multidimensional poverty is characterized by deprivations in health, education, and living standards indicators. Mali had the highest reported intensity of multidimensional poverty with 57.13% in 2015, indicating a significant proportion of its population was deprived in multiple dimensions. In contrast, Serbia showed a notable decrease in its intensity, from 42.65% in 2010 to 38.10% in 2019. China's reported intensity was 43.21% in 2010, while Gabon's figure was 46.98% in 2000. Sao Tome and Principe had an intensity of 41.31% in 2019. The chart also includes data for Albania, Angola, and the Dominican Republic, but their specific values are not provided in the text. The trend for most countries shown is a decrease in the intensity of multidimensional poverty over time, suggesting improvements in the dimensions considered.
The bar chart presents the number of ongoing wars worldwide across various years, distinguishing between civil wars and other types of conflicts (non-civil). In 1800, there was only one non-civil war reported. The number of ongoing wars peaked in 1920 with civil wars at 4 and other types at 8. The lowest recorded number of ongoing wars was in 1960 with no civil wars and only 1 other conflict. Notable spikes in civil wars occurred in 1992 with 6 wars and in 1864 with 6 as well. The data shows that the number of ongoing wars has varied significantly over time, with some periods, like the early 19th century, having very few reported conflicts. The years around the turn of the 20th century saw a dramatic increase in the number of wars, which then decreased notably in the mid-20th century. The last data point for 2011 shows a decrease in civil wars to 1, with no other conflicts reported.
The scatter plot shows the relationship between female labor force participation rates and fertility rates across various countries and regions for the year 2021. Each point represents a country or region, with the position along the x-axis indicating the labor force participation rate of women aged 15 and older (% of female population), and the position along the y-axis showing the fertility rate (children per woman). The size of the circles corresponds to the population size of each entity, with larger circles indicating more populous countries. The data suggests that there is no clear trend where higher female labor force participation rates correspond to lower fertility rates. For instance, Ethiopia has a high fertility rate of 4.1591 children per woman and a labor force participation rate of 57.6%, while France has a lower fertility rate of 1.79 children per woman and a labor force participation rate of 52.2%. Similarly, Japan has a fertility rate of 1.2974 and a labor force participation rate of 53.5%, while India has a higher fertility rate of 2.0329 and a labor force participation rate of 17.4%. The chart also highlights regional differences, with African countries generally having higher fertility rates and lower labor force participation rates, while countries in Europe and high-income countries generally show lower fertility rates and higher labor force participation rates.

Each country is represented by a circle, with the size of the circle proportional to the population of that country. A general trend observed is that alcohol consumption is higher in men compared to women. For instance, in Russia, men consume 17.95 liters of pure alcohol per capita, which is significantly higher than the 4.17 liters consumed by women. Georgia also shows a large disparity with 24.31 liters for men and 5.86 liters for women. On the lower end, countries like Indonesia and Iran have very low per capita alcohol consumption, with men in Indonesia consuming just 0.19 liters and women 0.03 liters. In contrast, women in Iran consume 0.25 liters, which is still less than half the consumption of men in Iran (1.35 liters). The data also indicates that there are considerable variations within continents. For instance, in Africa, the countries of Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya have high male alcohol consumption rates (19.93, 17.55, and 4.78 liters respectively), whereas female consumption rates are lower (4.88, 1.0, and 1.0 liters respectively). The United States shows a moderate consumption rate of 15.03 liters for men and 4.29 liters for women. The chart also highlights the significant differences in alcohol consumption between continents, with Europe showing the highest consumption rates overall.
