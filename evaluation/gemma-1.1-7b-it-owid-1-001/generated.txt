Over the years, the population under authoritarian regimes slightly decreased, reaching about 2.9 billion in 2022. Conversely, the population under hybrid regimes saw a significant increase, rising to over 1.4 billion by 2022. Notably, the population living in full democracies increased substantially, particularly from 2016 onwards, reaching approximately 631 million in 2022. The number of people living in countries with no regime data remained relatively low throughout the period, with a slight increase to around 44 million in 2022. The chart shows a concerning trend of increasing populations under hybrid regimes and decreasing populations under authoritarian regimes, suggesting a shift in global political landscapes towards more hybrid and democratic forms of governance over the examined period.
The area chart illustrates the global population's transition out of extreme poverty between 1820 and 2018, defined by living below the International Poverty Line of $1.90 a day. In 1820, approximately 206.6 million people were not in poverty, while a significantly larger number, around 794.5 million, were in poverty. Over the next 130 years, both groups grew, but the gap remained large, with over 1 billion people still in poverty in 1950 and around 1.18 billion not. A turning point occurred by 1981; the number not in poverty surged to approximately 2.53 billion, indicating a substantial shift towards better living conditions globally. The year 2000 showed a further dramatic increase, with over 4.5 billion people not in poverty, while the number in poverty decreased to around 1.63 billion. By 2018, the number not in poverty reached approximately 7.15 billion, and those in poverty dropped significantly to about 674.2 million. The chart reflects a significant progress in reducing extreme poverty over the two centuries, with a notable acceleration in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between educational attainment and poverty levels in various countries and regions in 2019. Educational attainment is measured by the average number of years of total schooling for the population aged 15-64, and poverty is measured by the share of the population living below $3.65 a day. The plot shows that countries like Malawi, Mozambique, and India have high poverty rates (above 80%) with lower educational attainment (below 10 years). In contrast, countries such as Russia, Ukraine, and the United States have very low poverty rates (below 1%) and high educational attainment (above 10 years). The size of the circles represents the population size of each entity, with larger circles indicating more populous countries. For instance, India and China have large populations but vary in poverty rates and educational attainment. The plot also highlights regional disparities, with African and some South American countries generally showing higher poverty rates and lower educational attainment compared to European and North American countries.
The line chart presents the percentage of school enrollment in private institutions at the primary education level for Estonia, Greece, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the United Kingdom from various years between 1971 to 2021.

Greece's enrollment fluctuated, starting at 7.42% in 1971, decreasing to 6.79% in 1990, and then slightly rising to 7.23% in 2010 before dropping to 6.81% in 2021. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had an increase from 4.18% in 2000 to 5.01% in 2010. The United Kingdom exhibits a significant rise, starting from 4.79% in 1990 and surging to 35.46% by 2021. The sharp upward trajectory in the UK's enrollment percentage, particularly from 2010 to 2021, indicates a major shift towards private primary education institutions in the country.
The line chart illustrates the average childbearing age for women in high-income and low-income countries from 1950 to 2015. High-income countries show a notable increase in the average age at which women have their first child over the period, starting at 28.262 years in 1950 and rising to 30.242 years by 2015. Low-income countries, on the other hand, exhibit a slight decline in the average childbearing age, starting at 29.862 years in 1950 and decreasing to 28.987 years in 2015. Throughout the years, the average age in high-income countries has been consistently higher than in low-income countries. The trend for high-income countries indicates a steady increase in the age at which women give birth, reflecting changes in societal norms, health care, and possibly the influence of education and economic factors. In contrast, the trend for low-income countries suggests a more stable pattern with minor fluctuations around the 30-year mark.
The line chart illustrates the age-standardized death rates from cardiovascular diseases per 100,000 people in the United States, separated by gender, over a span of seven decades, from 1950 to 2020. In 1950, the death rate for males was significantly higher at 624.54 compared to females at 444.53. Over the years, both genders experienced a decline in death rates, but the rate for males consistently remained higher than for females. By 2020, the death rates had decreased to 166.28 for males and 103.47 for females. Notably, the gap between male and female death rates narrowed over time, with the difference reducing from over 179 in 1950 to approximately 62 in 2020. The overall trend shows a substantial decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality for both males and females over the 70-year period, with the rate for males remaining substantially higher than the rate for females throughout the entire period.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between life expectancy at birth and current health expenditure per capita for various countries and regions in 2019. Life expectancy varies significantly, with high-income countries like Monaco and Germany reaching over 86 years, while low-income countries such as Lesotho and Nigeria have life expectancies below 60 years. Health expenditure per capita also shows a wide range, with high-income countries spending thousands of dollars per person, while low-income countries typically spend less than $200. The size of the circles represents the population size of each entity, with populous countries like India and China having larger circles. The plot also includes groupings by continent, indicating that countries within the same continent have similar life expectancies and health expenditures. For instance, African countries generally have lower life expectancies and health expenditures compared to European countries. The United States stands out with high life expectancy and very high health expenditure per capita.

The area chart illustrates the political regime classification in South America from 1789 to 2022, based on the criteria by Lührmann et al. (2018) and V-Dem's experts. In 1789, the region was comprised of closed autocracies, with no presence of other regime types. By 1850, electoral autocracies emerged, coexisting with closed autocracies. Over the next century, the landscape shifted significantly; electoral democracies appeared, and by 2000, closed autocracies vanished, indicating a transition to more democratic forms of governance. In 2018 and 2022, the presence of liberal democracies aged 1-18 years was noted, with a slight increase in liberal democracies aged 19-30 years in 2018 and a decrease in the same category in 2022. Liberal democracies aged 31-60 years saw a rise in 2018 but decreased in 2022, while those aged 61-90 years appeared in 2018 and vanished in 2022. The presence of liberal democracies aged 91+ years was not observed until 2018, where it appeared briefly, and then disappeared in 2022. Overall, the chart shows a clear trend towards democratic regimes in South America over the last two centuries, with a notable surge in electoral democracies and a growing presence of liberal democracies, albeit with some fluctuations in the latter category.

The area chart illustrates the total annual number of deaths from all causes, broken down by broad age categories, for the world from 1990 to 2019. Over this period, there has been a consistent increase in deaths among the elderly (70+ years), from approximately 15.5 million in 1990 to over 28.4 million in 2019. The 50-69 years age group also saw an increase in deaths, starting at around 11 million in 1990 and rising to nearly 15 million by 2019. For the 15-49 years age group, there was a peak in deaths around 2000 with over 8.6 million, followed by a decline to approximately 7.4 million by 2019. Deaths among children aged 5-14 and under 5 years have significantly decreased over the years. In 1990, there were over 1.2 million deaths in the 5-14 years age group, which dropped to around 677,000 by 2019, and for the under 5 age group, the number decreased from approximately 11.9 million in 1990 to around 5 million in 2019. The overall trend shows that while the number of deaths among the youngest age groups has decreased, the number of deaths among the older populations has increased, reflecting changes in global health and demographics.
The scatter plot illustrates the trade balance in cereals between different countries and regions in 2020, where imports are measured as the net sum of all cereal crop varieties, and exports are similarly measured. Countries above the grey line are net importers, while those below are net exporters. The Americas (FAO), Asia, and Europe show significant cereal trade, with the Americas importing over 92 million tonnes and exporting over 227 million tonnes, Asia importing over 235 million tonnes and exporting around 85 million tonnes, and Europe importing around 119 million tonnes and exporting over 242 million tonnes. In contrast, countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Canada exhibit a balance where exports greatly outweigh imports. The United States, a major importer, also shows a substantial trade deficit, importing over 118 million tonnes but exporting nearly 92 million tonnes. The plot also highlights the disparity between continents, with Asia and Africa being major importers and exporters, while many countries within these continents are net exporters or importers.

The 55-64 years age group saw a steady increase from 37.4 hours in 1900 to 46.2 hours in 1980, and then a decrease to 41.5 hours by 2005. The 65+ years age group had the highest initial leisure time at 47.9 hours in 1900, increasing to 63.4 hours in 1980, and then decreasing slightly to 61.7 hours by 2005. Overall, the chart indicates a growing trend in leisure time over the 20th century, with some fluctuations in the 21st century.
The scatter plot compares the Gini index of income in 2015 to the Gini index of income in 1990 for various countries, with the size of the circles representing the population size of the country. A general trend is visible where many countries have experienced a decrease in income inequality over the 25-year period, with the Gini index of income in 2015 being lower than in 1990. However, there are notable exceptions where income inequality has increased, such as in the case of South Africa, where the Gini index of income in 2015 is significantly higher at 66.24 compared to 66.93 in 1990. Sub-Saharan African countries generally show high levels of income inequality, with several countries like Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, and Zambia having Gini indices above 60 in 2015. In contrast, advanced industrial economies such as the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland have lower Gini indices, indicating lower income inequality. The chart also highlights the significant disparities in income levels between different regions, with East Asian and Pacific countries generally showing higher levels of income inequality compared to Latin America and Caribbean and Sub-Saharan African countries.
The area chart displays the annual number of deaths from encephalitis by age group in Serbia from 1990 to 2019. Over the years, there has been a general decline in the number of deaths across all age groups. In 1990, the highest number of deaths was among the 50-69 age group with 30 deaths, followed by the 15-49 age group with 22 deaths, and the 70+ age group with 13 deaths. By 2019, these numbers had decreased significantly to 32 deaths for the 70+ age group, which remained the highest among the age groups, and 14 deaths for the 15-49 age group. The 50-69 age group saw a decrease to 32 deaths, while the 5-14 and under-5 age groups had the fewest deaths, with 2 deaths in both years. The data indicates that encephalitis has had a greater impact on the older population (70+ years) compared to the younger age groups.
The line chart presents the annual number of deaths from chronic respiratory diseases in Burkina Faso and the United Arab Emirates from 1990 to 2019. In Burkina Faso, there has been a steady increase in deaths over the years, starting at 1,658 in 1990 and rising to 2,714 by 2019. The United Arab Emirates experienced a more modest increase, with deaths starting at 310 in 1990 and growing to 1,778 in 2019. Both countries show an upward trend, but the increase in Burkina Faso was more pronounced, likely due to the country's larger population. The data suggests that chronic respiratory diseases are a growing health concern in both nations, with the number of deaths consistently rising over the three decades.

The chart indicates a general trend of decline in patent applications for Sweden and a more variable pattern for the other countries over the observed periods.
The area chart illustrates the estimated number of deaths from tuberculosis (TB) worldwide, differentiated by HIV status from 2000 to 2022. In 2000, there were approximately 717,313 deaths among HIV-positive individuals, constituting 38% of the total estimated TB deaths. Over the years, this number has significantly decreased, reaching around 166,541 by 2022, which is about 29% of the total estimated TB deaths in that year. Despite the decrease in deaths among HIV-positive individuals, the total number of TB deaths has also declined, from approximately 1,879,561 in 2000 to around 1,112,212 in 2022. This suggests that while efforts to reduce TB deaths among those with HIV are effective, overall TB mortality has also been reduced over the two decades.
The line chart presents the estimated number of infant deaths (babies under one year old) who die each year for four different entities: Chad, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, and Nauru, over various years. For Chad, there is a consistent increase in infant deaths from 26,033 in 1980 to 48,167 in 2021. Indonesia shows a significant decrease in infant deaths, starting at 545,700 in 1952, peaking at 563,720 in 1960, and then dramatically declining to 84,901 in 2021.
