The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the death rate from indoor air pollution and GDP per capita for various countries in 2019. Death rates are measured per 100,000 individuals and are age-standardized. The plot shows a wide range of death rates, with Solomon Islands having the highest at approximately 397 deaths per 100,000, and Somalia and Central African Republic having rates close to 272 and 251 respectively. On the other end, countries like Australia, Bermuda, and Montenegro have very low death rates, all below 1.4. The plot also indicates that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have lower death rates from indoor air pollution. For instance, Australia with a GDP per capita of $49,379 has a death rate of approximately 0.03, while countries with lower GDP per capita such as Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo have higher rates of approximately 186 and 157 respectively. This suggests a correlation between economic prosperity and health outcomes related to indoor air pollution.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the annual average growth of trade as a share of GDP and GDP per capita for various countries and regions from 1945 to 2014. Trade growth is expressed as exports as a percentage of GDP, and GDP per capita is adjusted for inflation and differences in the cost of living. The plot shows a wide range of trade growth rates, with some countries like Vietnam reaching over 80%, while others like Ethiopia and Nigeria remain below 10%. Notably, there is no clear correlation between trade growth and GDP per capita, indicating that countries with higher GDP per capita do not necessarily have higher trade growth rates. The size of the circles represents the population of each entity, with China and India having the largest circles due to their large populations. The data also includes historical population estimates for continents not specifically mentioned in the text.
The bubble chart illustrates the relationship between the percentage of working children aged 7-14 who are out of school and the average weekly hours worked by these children in 2016. Each bubble represents a different country, with the size of the bubble corresponding to the population of that country. Jordan stands out with the highest percentage of out-of-school working children at approximately 20.02%, and also has a notable average weekly work hours of 15.54 hours. In contrast, countries like Afghanistan, Chad, and the Democratic Republic of Congo show both high percentages of working children and high average weekly work hours. The chart also indicates that countries in Africa tend to have higher percentages of working children compared to other continents. The data suggests a correlation between the number of hours worked by children and their involvement in employment, although the chart does not provide a direct numerical comparison of these factors.

The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the share of government consumption in GDP and GDP per capita for various countries and regions in 2019. Each point represents a country, with the size of the circle corresponding to the population of that country. The horizontal axis shows GDP per capita on a logarithmic scale, while the vertical axis indicates the share of government consumption in GDP. Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have a lower share of government consumption in GDP, as seen with the United States and Norway. In contrast, countries with lower GDP per capita, such as Equatorial Guinea and Syria, have a higher share of government consumption. The plot also highlights regional differences, with African countries generally showing higher government consumption shares and lower GDP per capita, while European countries have lower government consumption shares and higher GDP per capita. The data suggests a negative correlation between the two variables, implying that as a country's GDP per capita increases, the share of government consumption in GDP tends to decrease.

The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the burden of disease, measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 individuals, and GDP per capita (PPP) for various countries and regions in 2019. The plot shows a general trend where countries with lower GDP per capita tend to have higher disease burdens. For instance, countries like the Central African Republic, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe, with GDPs per capita below $3,000, exhibit some of the highest disease burdens, exceeding 50,000 DALYs. In contrast, wealthier nations such as Singapore, Ireland, and Germany, with GDPs per capita above $50,000, have significantly lower disease burdens, all under 25,000 DALYs. The size of the circles represents the population of each entity, with China and India having the largest circles due to their large populations, despite having moderate disease burdens and GDP per capita. The plot also includes aggregate data for continents, with Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America represented, but without specific GDP or disease burden data.
The line chart illustrates the average price on emissions covered by an emissions trading system (ETS), weighted by the share of the country's CO₂ emissions, for Albania, Cuba, and Malta from 1989 to 2021. For Albania and Cuba, the price remained at 0.0 throughout the entire period, indicating no weighted carbon price in their ETS. In contrast, Malta experienced a significant change. Starting with no weighted carbon price in 1989 and 1995, Malta introduced a price of approximately $26.13 in 2005. This price decreased to around $14.66 in 2010 and then dropped further to approximately $5.03 in 2015. However, Malta saw a substantial increase to nearly $27.90 by 2021. The data suggests that while Albania and Cuba have not implemented a weighted carbon price in their ETS, Malta has successfully introduced and adjusted such a price over the years.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, and GDP per capita (PPP) for various countries in 2019. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate greater inequality. Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have a wider range of income inequality. For instance, Brazil and Mozambique, despite having different GDP per capita levels, both exhibit high income inequality with Gini coefficients above 0.4. On the other hand, countries like Belgium and Luxembourg, with higher GDP per capita, show lower income inequality with Gini coefficients around 0.27. The size of the circles represents the population of each country, with larger circles indicating more populous countries. The chart also color-codes countries by continent, revealing regional patterns such as the high inequality in some South American countries like Brazil and the lower inequality in many European countries like Belgium and Luxembourg.
