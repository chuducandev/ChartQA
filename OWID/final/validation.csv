The vertical axis measures inequality in life expectancy (ranging from 0 to 0.4), and the horizontal axis represents health expenditure per capita. The size of each circle corresponds to the population of the country or region. We observe a cluster of countries with high inequality in life expectancy and low health expenditure per capita, primarily in Africa (e.g., Chad, Nigeria, Sierra Leone). Conversely, there are countries like Germany, Japan, and the United States where health expenditure is significantly high with relatively low inequality in life expectancy. Interestingly, the scatter plot also shows that higher health expenditure does not always correspond to lower inequality in life expectancy, as seen with the United States having higher expenditure but greater inequality compared to countries like Japan and Germany. The data also reflects the disparities between continents, with African and some Asian countries showing higher inequality and lower expenditure, while Europe, North America, and parts of South America exhibit lower inequality and higher spending on health.","Inequality in life expectancy vs. health expenditure per capita, 2019 Inequality in life expectancy vs. health expenditure per capita, 2019 ",,inequality-in-life-expectancy-vs-health-expenditure-per-capita

High-income countries, represented by dark red, disproportionately contribute to global CO₂ emissions relative to their population size. For instance, the United States, with only 4.26% of the world population, is responsible for more than 15% of CO₂ emissions. In contrast, India and China, denoted by lighter shades indicating lower-middle and upper-middle-income countries respectively, have significant shares of the world population (17.8% and 18.03%, respectively) but different emission shares, with China accounting for approximately 28% and India around 6.65%. Notably, low and lower-middle-income countries have smaller shares of CO₂ emissions compared to their population percentages, indicating an imbalance in emission contribution relative to population size across different income groups.

line,environment,"The line chart presents data on global earthquake-related deaths from the years 1500 to 2017. The chart shows considerable fluctuation in the number of deaths over the centuries. Noteworthy peaks include approximately 10,000 deaths in 1500, which is the starting point of the data. There is a significant spike in 1861 with over 16,000 deaths, the highest within this dataset. Other notable years with higher numbers of deaths include 1842 with 5,300 and 1975 with approximately 2,666 deaths. The data suggest both relatively high and low fatality events dispersed throughout the timeline. There appears to be a cluster of higher mortality events in the 19th century, suggesting either an increase in earthquake severity or improvements in record-keeping. Data for recent years, like 2017, show fewer deaths (1,222) than in earlier centuries, which might indicate advancements in early warning systems, construction standards, and disaster preparedness. However, it should be considered that data completeness has likely improved over time, and early records may be less accurate, which influences the perception of trends in earthquake-related fatalities.","Deaths from earthquakes, 1500 to 2017 Deaths from earthquakes, 1500 to 2017 ","Deaths from earthquakes includes direct deaths from the event plus those from secondary impacts (such as a tsunami triggered by an earthquake).

area,politics,"The area chart illustrates the global changes in political regimes from 1789 to 2022, based on classifications by Lührmann et al. (2018) and V-Dem experts. In 1789, closed autocracies were the only form of government. By 1850, a single liberal democracy emerged alongside 13 electoral autocracies. The number of liberal democracies began to rise gradually with the most significant growth occurring in the 20th century, especially post-1950. By 2000, the number of electoral democracies exceeded both closed and electoral autocracies combined, marking a historical shift. In 2018, liberal democracies aged 91+ years reached their peak at 6, while those aged 60-90 and 30-60 saw reductions. As of 2022, the number of closed autocracies increased slightly to 30, while electoral autocracies and electoral democracies changed to 58 and 58, respectively. The chart shows a decline in older liberal democracies (aged 91+) and an increase in younger liberal democracies aged 18-30. Overall, there has been a notable shift towards more democratic regimes since the 19th century, with a more recent trend of stabilization in the number of liberal democracies.","Countries that are long-standing liberal democracies, World Countries that are long-standing liberal democracies, World ","Political regimes based on the criteria of the classification by Lührmann et al.

scatter plot,health,"The provided scatter plot shows the relationship between child mortality rates and the percentage of the population practicing open defecation in various countries during the year 2020. Child mortality rates are measured as deaths per 1,000 live births. Several key observations can be made. Niger has the highest under-five mortality rate of approximately 11.63 deaths per 100 live births and the highest percentage of the population practicing open defecation, which is roughly 68%. In contrast, San Marino has the lowest recorded under-five mortality rate, nearly 0.18 deaths per 100 live births, and no open defecation practice amongst its population. The scatter plot also illustrates a general trend: as the percentage of the population practicing open defecation increases, the under-five mortality rate tends to increase as well. This is particularly evident in countries like South Sudan and Nigeria. Countries in Asia, such as China and Bangladesh, have relatively lower child mortality rates and percentages of population practicing open defecation, while many African countries show higher rates on both accounts. However, there are exceptions such as Russia and Peru, which have low child mortality rates despite having a non-zero percentage of the population practicing open defecation.

It portrays both the specific peak bloom dates and the twenty-year average peak bloom dates, spanning from the year 812 to 2023. A clear trend is visible in the chart, showing that the peak bloom date has shifted to earlier in the year over time, with more significant changes observable in recent history. For instance, in the year 1600, the twenty-year average day for peak bloom was recorded as April 14th (104.3 days after January 1st), and the actual peak bloom date that year was April 11th (101 days after January 1st).

Biomass, indicating the number of fish multiplied by their mass, initially increased from about 2.3 in 1970 to approximately 2.68 in 1980 before declining sharply to around 1.36 in 2000. It showed some recovery in subsequent years, with a value close to the 1970 level at about 2.33 in 2017. Fishing intensity, reflecting the fraction of fish population caught, started at 0.27 in 1970 and showed an increasing trend up to a peak of about 0.79 in 2000. Subsequently, there was a considerable drop in fishing intensity to 0.25 by 2017. The fluctuations in fishing intensity somewhat correspond to changes in fish stocks, especially the sharp increase in fishing pressure leading to the trough in biomass around the year 2000. Both fish stocks and fishing intensity aim to be at levels that are sustainable, marked by the dotted line at a value of 1 on the chart. Overall, the data suggests a movement towards better management of fish stocks in later years, with reduced fishing intensity and a rebound in biomass.","Fish stocks and fishing intensity by region, Australia Fish stocks and fishing intensity by region, Australia ",Fish stocks are measured by biomass: the number of individuals multiplied by their mass.

Over this period, the population living in non-democracies has expanded significantly, with a prominent rise shown post-1950. In 1800, almost the entire world's population lived in non-democracies or places with no regime data. The population living in democracies began to appear noticeably around 1900 and expanded incrementally by age of democracy, with higher numbers in newer democracies. By 1950, there were substantial segments of the population living in democracies of different ages. From 1950 onwards, the population in longstanding democracies (aged 60+ years) grew rapidly. As of 2000, the majority of the world's population lived in democracies, with the greatest share in democracies aged between 30 and 60 years. By 2020, the representation of the population in democracies had continued to increase, with the largest number living in democracies over 90 years old, followed closely by those in democracies aged 60-90 years.

Healthy life expectancy is defined as the average number of years lived free from disability or disease burden. The United States stands out with the highest health expenditure per capita at approximately $9775 and a healthy life expectancy of 67.69 years. In contrast, countries like the Central African Republic and Lesotho have both low healthy life expectancy, at 43.65 and 43.82 years respectively, and very low health expenditures per capita. There are some countries with modest health expenditure but relatively higher life expectancy, such as Italy and Sweden, suggesting more efficient health spending. Overall, a trend can be observed where countries with higher health expenditures tend to have higher healthy life expectancies. However, some countries deviate from this trend, indicating that higher spending does not always correlate with better health outcomes.
