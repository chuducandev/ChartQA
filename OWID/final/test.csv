Norway had a civil register in place from as early as 1750, maintaining this system throughout the shown timeline. Egypt and Haiti did not have civil registers until 1950 and 2015, respectively, indicating a modern adoption of this system. Venezuela established its civil register in 1900. By 2015, all four countries had civil registers implemented, reflecting a global trend towards structured civil documentation.","Country has a civil register, 1750 to 2015 Country has a civil register, 1750 to 2015 ","Civil registers are government agencies that record key events in the life trajectories of individuals, such as births, marriages, and deaths.",country-has-a-civil-register
bar,environment,"The chart presents the number of deaths from volcanic eruptions worldwide from 1570 to 2017 as recorded by the NGDC/NOAA. Notably, the number of eruption-related fatalities has varied significantly. A massive spike can be observed in 1672, with approximately 3,003 deaths, the highest recorded within the data set. Another significant peak occurred in 1757, where the deaths attributed to volcanic eruptions reached 1,053. Interestingly, the most recent centuries have seen fewer fatalities, with single to double-digit fatalities reported in the years 1893, 1910, 1927, 1944, 1961, 1978, 1995, and 2017, with the latter two years witnessing 68 and 19 deaths respectively. It is important to consider that due to availability, reporting, and evidence, more recent data tend to be more complete than historical records. Overall, the data indicates that while volcanic activity continues to be a threat to human life, the number of deaths resulting from such events has decreased notably in recent history.","Number of deaths from volcanic eruptions, 1570 to 2017 Number of deaths from volcanic eruptions, 1570 to 2017 ","Deaths from volcanic eruption events includes direct deaths from volcanic eruptions, in addition to secondary impacts (such as a tsunami or earthquake triggered by an eruption).

bar,health,"The bar chart presents the percentage change in mean height of men born in 1996 compared to those born in 1896 across various countries. Turkey leads with the highest increase at approximately 8.66%, indicating a significant shift in stature over a century. Bosnia and Herzegovina follow with a height increase of around 7.39%. Chile and Mauritius also show substantial height increases at about 6.92% and 6.14%, respectively. Men in Brunei experienced a growth of around 5.92%. The lowest increases are seen in Ethiopia and Rwanda, where the mean height changes are about 3.07% and 1.71%, respectively.

line,health,"The line chart illustrates the estimated prevalence of cardiovascular diseases per 100,000 people of both sexes, age-standardized, for Egypt, Iraq, Lithuania, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the world overall from 1990 to 2019. Egypt showed a gradual increase over the 29-year period, starting at approximately 8.77 cases in 1990 and rising to around 9.28 cases in 2019. Iraq's prevalence declined slightly from approximately 9.08 in 1990 to around 8.72 in 2019. Lithuania also exhibited a downtrend, starting at about 7.25 cases in 1990 and decreasing to approximately 7.17 in 2019. The United Kingdom showed a more pronounced decrease in the prevalence rate, from nearly 6.95 cases in 1990 to about 5.55 in 2019. The United States had fluctuations but ultimately decreased from approximately 8.86 cases in 1990 to around 7.62 in 2019. Finally, the global prevalence decreased marginally from about 6.73 cases in 1990 to approximately 6.43 in 2019. Interestingly, the United Kingdom experienced the sharpest overall decline among the entities represented.","Prevalence rate of cardiovascular diseases, 1990 to 2019 Prevalence rate of cardiovascular diseases, 1990 to 2019 ","Estimated prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, as a share of the population.",prevalence-rate-of-cardiovascular-disease
scatter plot,health,"The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the number of new cases of tetanus per 100,000 people and DTP3 (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis vaccine) immunization coverage among one-year-olds for various countries in 2019. A general trend can be observed where higher vaccine coverage corresponds with fewer tetanus cases, though some countries are outliers. For instance, Somalia had the highest number of tetanus cases (more than 20 per 100,000) with very low DTP3 coverage at 42%. Chad and Kenya also had relatively high tetanus incidence rates at 7.78 and 7.83 cases per 100,000, respectively, despite Kenyan immunization coverage being relatively high at 91%. Countries like Cuba, Monaco, and Albania with near-universal DTP3 coverage close to 99% had very low tetanus incidence rates. Interestingly, despite relatively high vaccination coverage, some countries such as Laos and Indonesia recorded a significant number of tetanus cases, suggesting that other factors may influence tetanus incidence rates in addition to vaccination coverage.","Tetanus cases vs. tetanus vaccination coverage, 2019 Tetanus cases vs. tetanus vaccination coverage, 2019 ","The tetanus vaccine is part of the DTP3 (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine.",tetanus-cases-vs-tetanus-vaccination-coverage
